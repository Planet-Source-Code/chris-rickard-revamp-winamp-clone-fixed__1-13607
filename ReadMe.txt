:WHAT IS REVAMP
reVAMP is a simple Winamp clone (made by nullsoft), reVAMP is written in MS visual basic 6.
It is a very beta version and does no where near contain all of the Winamp features, one 
major feature that it lax but i can't be fucked doing is the playlist/editor. Theoretically
i should have wacked it in, but i just want to check some ppl's responses to see if it is even
worth doing. NOTE: i don't actually think ppl will use this app, this is why it is only released with the sourcecode, this app has some nice features such as the progress bar, the volume and balance sliders etc.. all this stuff is original and you can use this for yourself.

:WHATS INCLUDED IN THE .ZIP
Well for starters, the Sourcecode. For Visual Basic (6, but should work in 5)
A compiled exe of the source, basically to check it out as a stable app.

:HOW DO I USE REVAMP
Pretty simply i thought :P
Basically the same as Winamp, but some buttons (next song, playlist etc..) don't work
due to.. well my lack of enthusiasm. You can right click for a popup menu with File info
and other stuff. It sits in the System tray and lets you control it from there. 
(just click on the reVAMP icon for the controls).

:OTHER STUFF
Well first id'e like to mention my mp3 control. Yupp, tis MS media player control...
Now i heard alot of people bagging this at PSC, but i don't see why? It is a reliable
mp3 control that provides easy access and is pretty much on everyones box. It also
saves time, unlike some other mp3 source's you don't have to spend time registering
the ocx's or dll's they stole from there packaged media players which we don't own.
So yeah, tell me what you think... Feel free to use the code, and certainly feel free
to add a playlist editor/other functions. I was going to wack in the VU meter for
ppl that can use it, But i am yet to find a Sound Display that works for my SB!Live.

So yeah, have fun.
