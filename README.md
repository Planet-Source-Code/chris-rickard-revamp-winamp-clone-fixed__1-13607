### Description

NOTE: This one Works (sorry 'bout last one) <BR>

reVamp is a Winamp clone made in Visual Basic 6<BR>

It's Current Features are: <BR>

* Winamp style Interface <BR>

* Sliding Progress/Volume/Balance bars <BR>

* Clickable Progress/Volume/Balance bars <BR>

* Tells % of Volume/Balance <BR>

* Full Read/Write ID3 tag Info <BR>

* Song duration Progress Bar (can click/slide) <BR>

* System tray icon (easy control) <BR>

* Moving name plate <BR> <BR>

This was basically just for fun, not for people to use, Naturally Winamp is better. I am yet to add a Playlist window due to the fact i didn't know if it was worth all the trouble. If people like it and want me to add it in, then just tell me and it'll be done :) <BR>

You can also vote for me if you think it's good.
